# cybersecurity notes

## welcome

welcome to my notes on cybersecurity. in these notes, we will learn about the basics of cybersecurity, including common vulnerabilities, exploits, and impacts. we will also learn how to write secure code and how to protect against common attacks.

disclaimer: these notes are for educational purposes only. do not use this information to attack systems that you do not own or have permission to attack. hacking is illegal and unethical. always get permission before testing the security of a system.

my notes will involve both hands on code examples and just general notes on cybersecurity. do not try to replicate the code examples on systems that you do not own or have permission to attack. also don't do it on any machine that you care about. i will be using a virtual machine for our code examples.

# terminology

we will introduce some terminology that we will be using throughout these notes:

- **vulnerability**: a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker.
- **exploit**: to use a vulnerability
- **impact**: the effect of an exploit

## CIA triad

the CIA triad is a model that is used to describe the core principles of information security. it stands for:

#### C: confidentiality
- ensuring that data is only accessible to those who are authorized to access it.
#### I: integrity
- ensuring that data is not altered by unauthorized users. information remains unchanged in transit and rest.
#### A: availability
- ensuring that data is available when needed to authorized users.

we also further break down the CIA triad into the following:

### vulnerable system CIA
- a system becomes vulnerable when it is compromised..

### subsequent system CIA
- but what are the subsequent effects of a system being compromised?

### more fine grained CIA

#### A: authentication
- ensuring that a user, data, or software is genuine
#### A: accountability
- maintaining identity and activity logs

## more terminology

- **exploit a vulnerability**: to take advantage of a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to a system.
- **prevention**: to stop an exploit from occurring. eg) prevent smashing the stack by randomizing the stack.
- **detection**: to identify an exploit after it has occurred. eg) detect a buffer overrun by monitoring the stack. another example, *Tripwire* is a tool that can be used to detect changes to files on a system.
- **recovery**: to recover from an exploit after it has occurred. eg) recover from a buffer overrun by restoring the stack to a previous state.
- **scanning**: probe systems on the internet to find vulnerabilities. eg) use *nmap* to scan a network for open ports.
- **vulernability scanner**: a tool that can be used to scan for known weaknesses
- **sniffer**: software that captures network trafffic while in transit. eg) *wireshark* is a popular sniffer.

## more more terminology
- **exploit**: a ready to run program that takes advantage of a vulnerability
- **side-channel attack**: eavesdropping, acoustic keyboard eavesdropping
- **root kit**: software designed to hide the fact that a system has been compromised. for example, replace `ls` on a unix system to hide the fact that rogue processes are running.
- **leet speak**: a form of writing that replaces letters with numbers or symbols. for example, "hacker" might be written as "h4ck3r". this is often used by hackers to obfuscate their code.
- **honeypot**: a server that acts as a decoy to lure attackers. for example, a server that is intentionally left unpatched to attract attackers.
- **threat modelling**: a formal approach to security
- **penetration testing**: a simulated attack on a system to identify vulnerabilities. for example, using *nmap* to scan a network for open ports.
- **red team**: a group of security experts who simulate attacks on a system. for example, a group of hackers who try to break into a company's network.
- **blue team**: a group of security experts who defend a system against attacks. for example, a group of security analysts who monitor a company's network for suspicious activity.
- **purple team**: a group of security experts that communicate between the red and blue teams. for example, a group of security analysts who coordinate the response to a security incident.

you don't need to memorize these terms, but you should be familiar with them and understand their meaning.

## defender vs attacker principles
1. the defender must defend all points; the attacker can choose the weakest point
2. the defender can defend only against known attacks; the attacker can probe for unknown vulnerabilities
3. the defender must be constantly vigilant; the attacker can strike at will
4. the defender must play by the rules; the attacker play dirty

### defender principles

#### compartmentalization
- separate systems so that a compromise in one system does not affect the others. for example, use a firewall to separate a web server from a database server.
- if one thing gets taken over, should not be able to take over other parts

#### multiple layers of security
- use multiple layers of security to protect against different types of attacks. for example, use a firewall, intrusion detection system, and antivirus software.
- get other people to check your work

#### don't volunteer information
- attacks commonly work in the dark and perform reconnaissance to uncover information about a target. don't make it easy for them. 
- don't show context, don't show your hand

#### fail safely
- if a system is compromised, it should fail in a safe manner. for example, if logins aren't working because of an internal issue, the rest of the web page should be working while only logins are halted.

#### practice simplicity
- the simpler a system is, the easier it is to secure. for example, use a simple password policy that is easy to enforce.

## the ten immutable laws of security
1. if a bad actor can persuade you to run his program on your computer, it's not your computer anymore
2. if a bad actor can alter the os on your computer, its not your computer anymore
3. if a bad actor has unrestricted physical access to your computer, its not your computer anymore
4. if you allow a bad actor to upload programs to your website, it's not your website anymore
5. weak passwords trump strong security
6. a computer is only as secure as the administrator is trustworthy
7. encrypted data is only as secure as the decryption key
8. an out of date virus scanner is only marginally better than no virus scanner at all
9. absolute anonymity isn't practical, in real life or on the web
10. technology is not a panacea (solution or remedy for all difficulties or diseases)

## common vulnerabilities

we list the most common vulnerabilities in order of how common they are, to motivate us to learn about them:
1. out-of-bounds writes
2. improper neutralization of input during web page generation
3. improper neutralization of input used in SQL commands
4. out-of-bounds reads

and here are some more (unordered):
- null pointer dereference
- use after free (when a program tries to access memory that has already been freed)
- hard coding credentials
- integer overflow


## writing secure code

here's some terminology to consider to when writing secure code:

#### assessment
- analysis of the environment and the system security requirements. what piece of software does this program run in (iOS, android, etc)?
- during this phase you create and document a security policy and plans for implementing that policy.

#### protection
- implementing a secuirity plan. this includes implementing security controls, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software.

#### detection
- identifying security incidents. this includes monitoring the network for unusual activity, such as unauthorized access attempts.

#### response
- responding to security incidents. this includes investigating the incident, containing the incident, and recovering from the incident.

# virtual machines

we will be using virtual machines to run our code examples. a virtual machine is a software that allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. this allows you to run different operating systems on the same hardware. we will be using virtual machines to run old operating systems that have known vulnerabilities. this will allow us to learn about cybersecurity by exploiting these vulnerabilities.

## ssh'ing into an ip address

how can we ssh into an old machine where we have the ip address?

```bash
ssh username@ip_address
```

we will typically get an error message like this:

```bash
Unable to negotiate with `ip_address` port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
```

this is because the server is using an outdated key exchange method. we can listen to the server's offer, but we just end up running into a different error message.

the reason we are looking into this is because we will be working work old machine images that may have security vulerabilities. it will be easier to exploit these vulnerabilities while we are ssh'd into the machine.

### red hat 7.2

for my notes, various different VMs. there is a pdf `VMs.pdf` that has the information of where to get the VMs and the login information. if you do not see this pdf, i might have removed it due to authorship reasons.

for example, for RH72BufferOveruns, the command to `ssh` into it can be found in `jots.md` and `VMs.pdf` but i add it here as well:
```
ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -c 3des-cbc hacker@10.10.10.12
```
where `10.10.10.12` is the ip address of the machine we are trying to ssh into.

# components of a computer system

### CPU
- executes instructions
- has registers to store data

### memory
- has stack and heap
- has program data
- has OS data

### instructions
- are executed by the CPU
- are loaded into memory from source code


now we ask the question. when we compile a program, it turns into an executable which can be run on a computer. this executable contains instructions. we ask the question, "how can we know what the instructions even mean? how are sure that a line of binary is an instruction to add somethong or just some data?"

well it depends on the CPU's architecture. the CPU looks at the instruction and determines what to do with it based on where the byutes are located and what values they are. we often represent these instructions in hex, because hex is a compact form.

### hexadecimal

hexadecimal is a base 16 number system. it uses the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F. it is used to represent binary data in a more compact form.

### converting between hex and binary

| Binary | Hexadecimal |
|--------|-------------|
| 0000   | 0           |
| 0001   | 1           |
| 0010   | 2           |
| 0011   | 3           |
| 0100   | 4           |
| 0101   | 5           |
| 0110   | 6           |
| 0111   | 7           |
| 1000   | 8           |
| 1001   | 9           |
| 1010   | A           |
| 1011   | B           |
| 1100   | C           |
| 1101   | D           |
| 1110   | E           |
| 1111   | F           |

hexidecimal usually starts with `0x` to indicate that it is a hex number. for example, `0x1A` is the hexidecimal representation of the binary number `00011010`.


### using gdb on a C program

we will learn how to effectively use gdb to debug a C program. this will help us understand how a program works at a low level.

consider the following C program:

```c
main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 6;
    int z = x + y;
    printf("z is %d\n", z);
}
```

we can compile this program with the following command:

```bash
gcc -g -o add add.c
```

this allows us to be able to use gdb on the program. we can run the program with the following command:

```bash
gdb ./add
```

now let's add a break point at the start of main and run gdb:

```bash
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
```

if do run, we see we are at the start of the main function since we added our breakpoint.

instead of typing `break`, we can also just type `b`. we could also break at a specific line number if we would like. for example:
```bash
(gdb) b 64
```

and to run, we could have used `r` instead. similarly, we can also step through code using the `step` command or `s` for short:
```bash
(gdb) step
``` 

moving on, we can also disassemble the main function with the following command:

```bash
(gdb) disassemble main
```

this will show us the assembly code for the main function. 

we can also see all the information about the registers with the following command:

```bash
(gdb) info registers
```

for this to work, we need to have executed some code (for example, we we set a breakpoint before).

note that we see many different register names like "ebp, esp, eip" or "rbp, rsp, rip". the "e" stands for "extended" and the "r" stands for "register". you might see "r" on a 64-bit system and "e" on a 32-bit system. we will list what these are for in the next section.

we can also use the command `x / 32` to see the next 32 bytes of memory. x stands for "examine" and 32 is the number of bytes we want to see. for example:

```bash
(gdb) x / 32 $esp
```
the above command will show us the next 32 bytes of memory starting from the stack pointer.

depending on the architecture, gdb might show us the memory in different ways. for example, on a 32-bit system, gdb might show us the memory in 4-byte chunks, while on a 64-bit system, gdb might show us the memory in 8-byte chunks.

## x86-64 registers

we will mostly only be inspecting the stack pointer, frame pointer, and instruction pointer but here's a list of all the registers and what they are used for:

rax: accumulator
- used for arithmetic operations

rbx: base
- used as a base pointer. this is a general purpose register.

rcx: counter
- used for loops and string operations

rdx: data
- used for I/O operations

rsi: source index
- used for string operations

rdi: destination index
- used for string operations

rbp: **base pointer** aka frame pointer
- points to the base of the stack frame.

rsp: **stack pointer**
- points to the top of the stack

rip: **instruction pointer**
- points to the next instruction to be executed


and for **the** 32-bit system it is the same, but with an "e" instead of an "r". for example, eax instead of rax.

# linux file system permissions
in this section we learn about the different file system permissions in linux. we will use the following commands:
- chmod
    - to change file permissions
- chown
    - to change the owner of a file
- chgrp
    - to change the group of a file
- find
    - to find files
- groups
    - to see what groups a user is in
- id
    - to see the user id
- ls
    - to list files
- mkdir
    - to make a directory
- stat 
    - to see the status of a file
- touch 
    - to create a file or update the timestamp of a file

some more commands you will want to know are:
- cat 
    - to concatenate files (print the contents of a file)
- grep 
    - to search for a pattern in a file. uses regular expressions.
- less 
    - to view a file one page at a time
- wc 
    - to count the number of lines, words, and characters in a file
  
- sudo 
    - to run a command as the super user

**a note on sudo**

sudo is a command that allows you to run a command as the "super user". users that are part of the sudo group can run commands as the super user. this allows them to perform administrative tasks, such as installing software or changing system settings. this is not the same as being the root user. there is only one root user on a system, and they have full control over the system. more on root later.


## users, groups, and permissions

every user has a user id (uid) and a group id (gid). the uid is a unique number that identifies the user, while the gid is a unique number that identifies the group. linux doesn't actually care about the user's name, it only cares about the uid and gid.

to see the uid and gid of a user, you can use the `id` command:

```bash
id
```

this will display something like
```
uid=1004(student) gid=1006(student) groups=27(sudo),116(admin),1006(student)
```

the name of the user and group is in parentheses. moreover, `groups` shows all the groups that the user is in. if you want to see only the group names you can add the `-nG` flag:

```bash
id -nG

# output
student sudo admin
```

to see specifically only the uid, you can use the `-u` flag, same for the gid:

```bash
id -u
id -g
```


### what are groups?
groups are well, groups of users. a user can be in multiple groups. groups are used to manage permissions on files and directories. it is a convenient way to give multiple users access to the same files.

when a user creates a file, the file is owned by the user and the group that the user is in. the user has a set of permissions that determine what they can do with the file. there are three types of permissions: 
- read
- write
- execute

note that the filesystem path of the group file is `/etc/group`. you can check for yourself using `man group`.

#### root group

the root group is a special group that has all permissions on all files. this is the group that root belongs to. so "root" is a user and a group. to root group always has `gid=0`. you can see this by running `id -g root`.

```bash
id -g root

# output
0
```
the above will look for a user named "root" and return the gid of that user.

you could also check the group file and use `grep` to find the root group:

```bash
grep -i "root" /etc/group

# output
root:x:0:
```

we could also use `getent`. `getent` is a command that gets entries from a database. in this case, we are getting the entry for the shadow group. the `gid` for the shadow group is always `42`. 

`getent` actually shows us the entire entry for the shadow group, which includes the group `name:password:gid:members` (in that format).  now we will use `getent` to get the entry for the root group:

```bash
getent group root

# output
root:x:0:
```

we see that for our password, we have an `x` which means that the password is stored in the `/etc/shadow` file and we can't see it. and for the members, we see nothing. however, we know that we should have the `root` user as a member of the `root` group. the reason for this is because `getent` only shows supplementary group memberships. so any primary group memberships are not shown.

#### root vs sudo
`sudo` is only a group, whereas `root` is a user and a group. users in the `sudo` group are allowed to use `sudo` command to elevate their privileges. `root` always has the highest privileges on a system. `sudo` doesn't have higher privileges than `root`, it just allows users to temporarily access root-level privileges.

#### shadow group

the shadow group is another special group that has permissions to view the `/etc/shadow` file. this file is used for managing user passwords. note that there is no user named "shadow" unlike for `root`. we can see the gid of the shadow group by using `grep`, or we could also use `getent`:

```bash
getent group shadow

# output
shadow:x:42:
```

#### find command

the `find` command is used to search for files in a directory. you can use it to search for files based on their name, size, or permissions. for example, to find all files in the current directory that have the name "file.txt", you can use the following command:

```bash
find . -name file.txt
```

you can also  find all files owned by a specific user by using the `-user` flag:

```bash
find . -user username
```

similarly, if you wanted to find all files owned by a specific group, you could use the `-group` flag:

```bash
find . -group groupname
```

and if you want to find all files that have a specific permission, you can use the `-perm` flag:

```bash
find . -perm 644
```

and if you want only directories, you can use the `-type` flag:

```bash
find . -type d
```

what's even more interesting is the `-exec` flag. this flag allows you to execute a command on the files that are found. for example, to delete all files that have the name "file.txt", you can use the following command:

```bash
find . -name file.txt -exec rm {} \;
```

the `{}` is a placeholder for the file that is found, and the `\;` is used to terminate the command.

now imagine if we wanted to elevate a permission of all files in a directory. we could use the following command:

```bash
find /path/to/directory -type f -perm 777 -exec chmod 750 {} \;
```

## file permissions

you can check the permissions of a file by doing `ls -l dir`. this will show you the permissions of every file in the directory `dir`. or you can specify the path to a file like `ls -l /path/to/file`.

```bash
ls -l /etc/group

# output
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 978 2024-10-02 17:49 /etc/group
```

you can also use the `stat` command to see the permissions of a file. stat will show you a lot of information about the file, including the permissions. for example:

```bash
stat /etc/group

# output
  File: `/etc/group'
  Size: 978             Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: 801h/2049d      Inode: 99421       Links: 1
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
student@ubuntu804Server:~$ .000000000 -0400Modify: 2024-10-02 17:49:25.000000000 -0400Change: 2024
```

here, we see Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--). the `0644` is the octal representation of the permissions. if you want to see the permissions in octal, you can use the `-c` flag:

```bash
stat -c %a /etc/group

# output
644
```

the `%a` is a format string that tells stat to display the permissions in octal. you can see all the format strings by running `man stat`.


# WYSINWYX

now we will begin to really learn about cybersecurity. 

what you see is not what you execute. this is one of the most fundamental ideas in computer security. the idea is that your source code may seem fine, but what happens in the background at a low level may include hidden vulnerabilities.

for example, consider the following code:
```c
set(password, '\0', len);
free(password);
```
where `password` is some pointer to a string that contains sensitive data and len is the length of the string. a compiler might attempt to "optimize" this code never actually compiling code to call `set` because it sees that the memory is never used later on. this would leave the password in memory, even after it has been freed.

the idea is that we can't trust the source code for program security. a better security check would be to examine the compiled code and test for vulnerabilities there. you never know what the compiler might do to your code.

another such example is cases where libraries not part of the standard library are used. for example, in C, if you want to make a multithreaded program, you would typically use `pthread.h`, but this is an external library not part of the standard C framework. hence the compiler might create security risks for multithreaded programs that it would otherwise not have for single-threaded programs. 

### unexpected function pointer behavior

below is an example of how we can implicitly call a function pointer by manipulating memory:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

void f2() {
    printf("hello from f2\n");
}

void f1() {
    printf("jaja from f1\n");
}

int main() {
    int (*f) (void);
    // this is a function **pointer**
    // recall the syntax: int (*f) (void) means that f is a pointer to a function that returns and integer and takes no arguments (void)
    

    int diff = (char*)&f2 - (char*)&f1; 
    // gives offset between f1 and f2

    f = &f1;
    f = (int (*)())((char*)f + diff); 
    // f now points to f2
    
    (*f)(); 
    // indirect call to f2
}
```
not that we simplify took the difference between the memory addresses of the two functions and added that to the memory address of the first function. this allowed us to call the second function using the function pointer.

this may seem obvious or trivial, but we extend this idea to buffer overruns and other security vulnerabilities. what if we could manipulate memory to call a function that we shouldn't be able to call? this is the basis of many security vulnerabilities.


# buffer overruns

buffer overruns are a common security vulnerability in C programs. they occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. this can cause the program to crash, or worse, allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

## how buffer overruns work

the idea is that we are able to write more data to a buffer than it can hold. for example, imagine suppose we are in a function. recall we will have some `$ebp` that points to the base of the stack frame. 

what's special about `$ebp` is that usually the return address is stored right above it in memory. recall how a stack looks in memory (single stack frame):
```
High Memory
+------------------+
| parameter 2      |  [ebp + 12]
| parameter 1      |  [ebp + 8]
| return address   |  [ebp + 4]  <--- This is where we'll return to
+------------------+
| previous ebp val |  [ebp]      <--- ebp register points here
+------------------+
| local var 1      |  [ebp - 4]
| local var 2      |  [ebp - 8]
| local var 3      |  [ebp - 12]
+------------------+  <--- esp points here
Low Memory
```
if we can somehow change the value of what is in the return address, we can change where the program will return to. this is the basis of a buffer overrun.

suppose we have the address of a local variable in the function. for example, if we have an array on the stack, we know the array points to values that are just a few bytes below the base pointer. 

if we can calculate the offset between the local variable and the return address, we can overwrite the return address with the address of a function that we want to call. this is the basis of a buffer overrun. the only thing is; we would need permission to overwrite the return address.

we dont have permission to dereference the return address as attempted below:
```
(ebp + 4)* = whatever
```

but we can implicitly overwrite the return address by overwriting to the buffer. note that even though variables are added downwards in memory, the when we write to the buffer, we are writing upwards in memory. for example, when we do `arr[1] = whatever`, we write to the memory address `arr + 1 * sizeof(elem)`. so if our `whatever` value is large enough, it can bleed all the way into the return address.

then when the function returns, it will return to the address that we wrote to the buffer and can execute arbitrary code.

## attempting a buffer overrun

see the c program in `code_examples/bufferoverruns/stack.c`

```c
#include<stdio.h>

// global variables, available to the whole program
char c;
short s;
int i;
long l;
float f;
double d;

int sumNums(int n, int m){
	int i;
	int sum=0;
	char c[16];
	i=n;
	while(i<m){
		sum += i;
		i=i+1;
	}
	
	/*
	 * modify this so 
	 * that the return address is overwritten with the address of hacked
	c[0]=0xb0;
	c[1]=0x25;
	c[2]=0x33;
	c[3]=0x55;
	*/

	return sum;
}

int mulNums(int n, int m){
	printf("multiplying %d and %d\n", n, m);
	return n*m;
}

void hacked(){
	printf("I've been hacked\n");
}

int main(int argc, char ** argv){
	sumNums(3,7);
	mulNums(8,5);
}
```

we will compile this with the `-g` flag:
```bash
gcc -g stack.c -o stack
```

and run it with gdb:
```bash
gdb ./stack
```

we can then use `list` to list the sumNums and main function, then use `b` to set some breakpoints:
```bash
list sumNums 
b 93 # before the "modify this" comment
list main
b 112 # on the call to sumNums
```

we can then examine the memory at the frame pointer with the following command:
```bash
x/32w $ebp
```

this will show us the next 32 words of memory starting from the frame pointer. note that this will not work on modern systems and compilers. you will want to use the RH72BufferOverruns VM for this (see `VMs.pdf`).

if we tried doing just `x/32`, we might get a message like "Cannot access memory at address 0x0" since we are trying to access memory that we don't have permission to access. we include the `$ebp` to tell gdb to start at the frame pointer.


# SQL injections

before we get into SQL injections, here's some brief background on SQL:

### SQL intro

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. it is a language used to interact with databases. it is used to create, read, update, and delete data in a database. let's see some syntax

```SQL
CREATE TABLE users (
	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR(100),
	age INT
);


INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 25);

SELECT * FROM users;

UPDATE users SET age=26 WHERE name='Alice';

DELETE FROM users WHERE name='Alice';

DROP TABLE users;
```

each of these commands is a **SQL query**. a SQL query is a string that is sent to a database to perform some operation.


### PHP intro

PHP is a server-side scripting language. it is used to create dynamic web pages. PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is sent to the client as HTML. PHP code is embedded in HTML code using special tags. let's see some syntax:

```php

<?php
	$name = $_GET['name'];
	$age = $_GET['age'];
	
	echo "Hello, $name. You are $age years old.";
?>
```

### injections

we will now show some examples of how PHP code can be vulnerable to SQL injections.

the above code is vulnerable to **PHP injections**. this is when an attacker sends malicious input to a PHP script. this input is then executed as code on the server. this can allow an attacker to read, write, or delete data from the database.

for example, consider the following code:

```php
<?php
	$name = $_GET['name'];
	$age = $_GET['age'];
	
	$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='$name' AND age='$age'";
	$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
?>
```

if an attacker sends the following input to the script:

```
name=alice' OR '1'='1' -- &age=25
```

the query will be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='alice' OR '1'='1' --' AND age='25'
```

this query will return all the rows in the users table, since `'1'='1'` is always true. the `--` is a comment in SQL, so the rest of the query is ignored. this allows the attacker to read all the data in the database.

essentially, using ' affter the name allows the attacker to inject their own SQL code into the query. this is a SQL injection. we can use **prepared statements**.

### prepared statements

prepared statements are a way to prevent SQL injections. they allow us to separate the query from the data. this way, the data is never executed as code. here's an example of how to use prepared statements in PHP:

```php
<?php
	$name = $_GET['name'];
	$age = $_GET['age'];
	
	$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=? AND age=?";
	$stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $query);
	mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "si", $name, $age);
	mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
?>
```

or in python:

```python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = connection.cursor()

cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=? AND age=?', (username, password))

user = cursor.fetchone()

connection.close()
```

in this example, the `?` are placeholders for the data. the data is then bound to the placeholders using `mysqli_stmt_bind_param`. this way, the data is never executed as code, so SQL injections are prevented. this may seem trivial, but a lot of security vulnerabilities come down to simple mistakes like this. in fact, a third of all security vulnerabilities are due to SQL injections.

let's just take a second to understand the code as well, in case you are unfamiliar with SQL. the sqlite3 is a library that allows us to interact with an sqlite database. we first connect to the database, then create a **cursor** object. a cursor is used to execute SQL queries. it's just like a cursor in a text editor, it points to a specific location in the database.  

# forensic disk mounting

a very common task in cybersecurity is to mount a disk image and examine its contents. this is often done when investigating a security incident. in this section, we will learn how to understand disk images and how to mount them.

## disk images

first let us understand what exactly a disk image is. a disk image is like a snapshot of a disk. by disk, we mean a hard drive, a usb drive, or any other storage device. it may even be a virtual disk (more on this in a bit).

a disk image contains all the data on the disk, including:
- the file system:  this is the structure that the operating system uses to organize files on the disk. it includes information about the files, such as their names, sizes, and locations. for example, linux uses ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems, while windows uses ntfs.
- the files: the actual data that is stored on the disk. this includes documents, pictures, videos, and other files.
- boot sectors: the information that the computer needs to boot from the disk. more info on this below

- empty/deleted space: the space on the disk that is not being used. this includes files that have been deleted but not overwritten. this space can contain sensitive information that can be recovered using forensic tools.

you can have a **virtual disk image** or a **physical disk image**. they are in effect the same thing, one is just a disk image of an actual physical disk, and one is a disk image of a virtual disk, a disk for a virtual machine.

## virtual disks

a virtual disk (aka virtual disk image) is a disk image that is used by a virtual machine. as we know, virtual machines are software that allows you to run an operating system within another operating system. the virtual machine uses a virtual disk to store the operating system and data, and this disk is stored as a file on the host machine. 

### physical vs virtual disks
so for distinction,
- physical disk != physical disk image
- virtual disk == virtual disk image

a physical disk is the actual hardware disk, while a physical disk image is a file that contains a copy of the data on the disk. we need to make a disk image of a physical disk to work with it in a virtual machine.

a virtual disk is a disk that is used by a virtual machine, it is already an image. just make a copy of it and work with it directly (so you don't mess up the original).

### disk image formats
disk images are often stored in the following formats:
- **.raw**: a raw disk image (sometimes .dd or .img) is the *simplest form* of a disk image. it contains a bit-for-bit copy of the disk with no additional metadata, compression, or special formatting. think of it as a "pure data" version.
- **.vmdk**: a vmdk disk image is used by vmware virtual machines. it contains a copy of the data on the disk, as well as information about the disk geometry and partition layout.
- **.vdi**: a vdi disk image is used by virtualbox virtual machines. it contains a copy of the data on the disk, as well as information about the disk geometry and partition layout.
- **.vhd**: a vhd disk image is used by microsoft virtual machines. it contains a copy of the data on the disk, as well as information about the disk geometry and partition layout.
- **.qcow2**: a qcow2 disk image is used by qemu virtual machines. it contains a copy of the data on the disk, as well as information about the disk geometry and partition layout.

formats like `.vmdk`, `.vdi`, `.vhd`, and `.qcow2` contain additional metadata that describes the disk image. this metadata includes information about the disk geometry, partition layout, and other disk properties. this metadata is used by the virtual machine to read and write data to the disk image.



## boot sectors

if you want to learn about boot sectors, here's a bit of info. this is a bit of an aside, so feel free to skip this section if you're not interested.
  - boot sectors located at the beginning of the disk
  - they specifically known as sector 0
  - they tell the computer how to boot the operating system
  - every disk has a sector 0 (boot sector), but not every boot sector contains bootable code
  - for example, if you have your OS on a specific SSD (say C:), then the C: drive is a *bootable disk*
  - your C: drive then has:
	- a full boot sector with actual **bootstrap** code
	- instructions on how to load the OS
	- the BIOS/UEFI knows how to read the boot sector and load the OS
  - non-bootable disks (like additional storage drives) have the following in sector 0:
    - contain a volume boot record (VBR)
    - the VBR contains information about the file system on the disk such as
      - volume structure
      - basic disk parameters
    - lacks actual boot code
    - more like a table of contents for the disk, rather than startup code
  
and this is why you can't just copy windows files to any disk and expect it to boot. the disk needs to have the correct boot sector. that is, you must make it bootable. 

there are two main types of boot sectors:
1. master boot record (MBR)
	- located in first 512 bytes of disk
	- first 446 bytes contain boot code
	- next 64 bytes contain partition table
	- last 2 bytes contain boot signature (0x55, 0xAA) which validates that it's a boot sector
2. GUID partition table (GPT)
	- newer than MBR
	- stores data in the first and last sectors of disk for redundancy
	- uses CRC32 checksums to validate data which makes it more reliable than MBR
	- supports disks larger than 2TB
	- provides up to 128 partitions

## disk mounting

now that we have a basic understanding of disk images, let's learn how to mount them and what that exactly means. mounting a disk image is when you take a disk image file from one operating system and make it accessible to another operating system. this allows you to read and write data to the disk image as if it were a physical disk.

essentially, it allows you to examine a disk image in a controlled environment without running the original operating system that the disk image came from. this is useful for forensic analysis, data recovery, and other security-related tasks.

here are some common approaches:
1. **offline mounting**
	- where you attach the virtual disk as a data disk (non-bootable) to a virtual machine
2. **write-blocked mounting**
	- where you mount the disk in read-only mode to prevent accidental writes
3. **mount to VM**
	- attaching a virtual disk from one VM to another VM for analysis

these are often done using tools like:
- vmware's mount utility
- virtualbox' vboxmanage
- ftk imager
- encase
- libvirt and qemu tools for kvm/qemu environments

we will do the third approach in this section, *mount to VM*, using vmware's mount utility.
